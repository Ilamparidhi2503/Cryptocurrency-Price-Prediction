Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM

This project builds a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict cryptocurrency prices based on historical data. The dataset includes multiple cryptocurrency price records, and the model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze and forecast future price trends.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Data preprocessing and handling missing values

Normalization of cryptocurrency price data

Sequence creation for LSTM training

LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting

Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

Cryptocurrency Prices Dataset.csv

Cryptocurrency Prices Dataset v1.csv

The datasets are merged based on common columns, and missing values are forward-filled to maintain data consistency.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM Model)

Pandas (Data Handling)

NumPy (Numerical Computations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Data Preprocessing)
